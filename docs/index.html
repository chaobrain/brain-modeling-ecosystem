            <h3>Powered by JAX</h3>
            <p>JAX is a Python library for efficient array-oriented computation and program transformation. JAX's flexible and modular approach has encouraged communities across AI, scientific computing, simulation and more to build ecosystems on top of it.</p>
            <p>JAX is often compared to neural network libraries like PyTorch, but the core JAX package contains very little specific to deep learning. Instead, JAX encourages modularity, where domain-specific libraries are developed separately from the core package. This helps drive innovation as researchers and other users explore what's possible.</p>
