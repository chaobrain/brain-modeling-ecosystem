Brain Simulation Ecosystem
==========================

BrainX is an open ecosystem for building, running, and studying brain
simulations across scales. It brings together JAX-native libraries for
unit-safe computation, sparse event processing, reusable experiment tooling,
stateful model construction, biophysical and neural-mass modeling, and
learning-driven dynamics. For the project landing page and broader ecosystem
overview, see `brainx.chaobrain.com <https://brainx.chaobrain.com/>`_.

**This page is a summary of the BrainX documentation**. It introduces the core
packages, shows how the layers fit together, and points you to tutorials that
move from foundational tools to complete simulation workflows.

If you are setting up BrainX for the first time, start with the
:doc:`installation tutorial <install>` to prepare your environment, install the
required packages.

The tutorials are organized around the BrainX package layers:

 - Physical Units :  ``brainunit``
 - Events & Tools :  ``brainevent`` ``braintools``
 - State Runtime :  ``brainstate``
 - Models :  ``brainpy.state`` ``braincell`` ``brainmass``
 - Online Learning :  ``braintrace``
